/**
 * Hey all! 
 * 
 * We don't have class this week. Please review the notes from last class in the notes folder.
 * 
 * Make sure you're comfortable with basic CRUD methods of these data types.
 * 
 * Then try to do the questions in the assignments folder.
 * 
 * Here's how I would work on the assignments: 
 * 1) Open a new Replit tab and copy the assignments to its `index.js` or
 * 2) Press "Fork" in Replit. This should create a copy in your Replit account. Work on the questions in the `index.js` file or 
 * 3) Download this repo as zip folder (third button next to Files) and open it in VSCode. Then work on the questions in Quokka.
 * 
 * Have fun and Good Luck! 
 * 
 * See you next week!
 * 
 * Harry
